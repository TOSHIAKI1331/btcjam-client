## Installation & Configuration

If you want to run the application by yourself here are the steps for you.

First you need to clone the [repository from GitHub](http://github.com/btcjam/btcjam-client)

    git clone git://github.com/btcjam/btcjam-client.git

Install all the gems

    bundle install

And migrate the databse

    rake db:migrate

At this point the application should be ready to run, but it won't
communicate correctly with the provider.

Go to [BTCJam](https://btcjam.com) and register your application using the settings
tab at the dashboard.

The callback url for this application will look like this

    http://localhost:3000/users/auth/btcjam/callback

You need to set up environment
variables to indicate the oauth2 provider values. In your environemnt
file set up these variables

    BTCJAM_APP_ID = "375c2e3fd..." # ID for your app registered at BTCJam
    BTCJAM_APP_SECRET = "6a2fa82ab..." # Secret
    BTCJAM_APP_URL = "https://btcjam.com" # BTCJam API URL


Now you are ready to start the app

    rails s
